One advantage to refactoring code is that we only need to make small changes to our code in order to analyze this large dataset. The disadvantages are numerous if you are not organized - commenting throughout the code to explain the purpose of the different sections is immensely helpful. If your code is not organized and annotated, it can be challenging to identify where the code needs to be edited in order to work. 

When refactoring this code it was important to keep organized in order to ensure the code works properly and mistakes can be identified and fixed. It was also faster after it was refactored, meaning that if you were working with an even larger dataset, the amount of time it might save could be significant.
